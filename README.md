# TransmogOutfitManager
## A WoW Cataclysm Classic transmogrification helper

![UI Demonstration](/img/TOM_UI_Demo1.png)

This AddOn enhances the Cataclysm Transmogrification interface by adding the ability to save predefined outfits to the default Transmog UI, allowing for easy switching between transmog sets.

Sets are stored on a per-character basis in the WTF folder, specifically under `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\<ACCOUNTNAME>\<REALM>\<CHARACTER>\SavedVariables\TransmogOutfitManager.lua`

Inspired by [Transmog Outfits](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/transmog-outfits)

### Limitations / To-Do
- UI has room for QoL improvements
